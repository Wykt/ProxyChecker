# Issues known

* Optimisation: I know the program is not optimized, I code in c# since 3 days, i just know C# because before I coded in Java and the Java is very similary to C#.
* Proxies Hits File saving in Macintosh Encoding, so some program and the ProxyChecker can't load the file until you paste in another text file the content.
